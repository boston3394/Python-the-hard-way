Operators
+ adds
- subtract right operand from the left
* multiplys 2 operands
** - exponent calculations
/ divide left operand from the right. always results in float
// - floor division
% - modular remainder
< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal
>= greater than or equals
== equals
!= does not equals

+= equals + 1, a += 1 is a = a + 1
-= c -= a is c = c - a
*= c *= a is c = c * a
/= c /= a is c = c / a
//= floor division
%= takes modulus and assigns result to left operand
**= performs exponent and assigns result to left operand
